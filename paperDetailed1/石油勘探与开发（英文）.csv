The adsorption law of slick water under different displacement time, concentrations, p H values and temperatures of polymer were tested by traditional displacement experiment and UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The adsorption equilibrium time was 150 min, the amount of adsorption was proportional to the concentration of the polymer, and the maximum adsorption concentration was 1 800 mg/L. With the increase of p H value, the adsorption capacity decreased gradually, the adsorption capacity increased first and then decreased with the increase of temperature, and the adsorption capacity was the largest at 45 ℃. The adsorption patterns of polymers on shale were described by scanning electron microscopy and magnetic resonance imaging. It is proved that the adsorption of polymer on shale led to the destruction of the network structure of anionic polyacrylamide molecules, and the shale adsorption conformation was characterized qualitatively. Finally, according to the adsorption law and adsorption mechanism, it is proposed to reduce the adsorption quantity of polymer on shale surface by using hydrogen bond destruction agent. The effects of hydrogen bond destruction on four kinds of strong electronegative small molecules were compared, the hydrogen bond destroyer c was the best, which lowered the adsorption capacity by 5.49 mg/g and recovered permeability to 73.2％.

The throat is the main factor controlling the physical properties of the Chang 6 and Chang 8 members reservoirs: The lower the permeability, the smaller and the more concentrated the throat radius and the larger the proportion of the throats in the effective storage space. There are several obvious differences between Chang 6 and Chang 8 members: (1) with the increase of permeability, the contribution of the relative large throats to the permeability in the Chang 8 member reservoir is more than that in the Chang 6 member reservoir; (2) the control effect on pore-throat ratio of the nano-throats in the Chang 6 member reservoir is more significant. The sedimentary action determines the primary pore structure of the Chang 6 and Chang 8 members sand bodies, and the diagenesis is the main factor controlling the densification of the reservoirs.

With this model, the influence factors on the cavitation intensity are investigated. The results show that the destructiveness of cavitating jet in breaking rocks depends on the bubble's first collapse, with decreasing intensity in the subsequent collapses. The self-resonating effect significantly enhances the cavitation intensity by promoting the collapse pressure and elongating its duration. Hydraulic parameters are proven to be the dominating factors influencing cavitation intensity: while collapse intensity monotonously increases with jet velocity, there exists an optimum ambient pressure where highest collapse intensity can be achieved. Conversely, the fluid properties show minor influences: cavitation intensity only slightly decreases with the increasing of fluid's density and barely changes with the variation of viscosity and surface tension. The results from this investigation help to uncover the mechanism of the enhanced erosion potential of self-resonating cavitating jet. The conclusions can be used to further improve the performance of self-resonating cavitating jet in field applications.",

Through analyzing the monitoring data and numerical simulation results of a typical super heavy oil block developed by SAGD in Fengcheng oilfield in Xinjiang, NW China, the development patterns of steam chamber and temperature variation law in the observation well at different stages are determined.

The calculated chamber velocity at different time was applied to predict the temperature distribution of oil drainage zone at the edge of steam chamber and SAGD oil rate. The results indicate that temperature function of high temperature zone in the observation well temperature curve has a linear relationship with measuring depth.

It is initially expected that the amount of natural gas resources from underground coal gasification to be 272-332 trillion cubic meters, which are about triple the sum of conventional natural gas, or equivalent to the total unconventional natural gas resources. According to the differences of coal reaction mechanism and product composition of underground coal gasification, the underground coal gasification can be divided into three development modes, hydrogen-rich in shallow, methane-rich in medium and deep, supercritical hydrogen-rich in deep. Beyond the scope of underground mining of coal enterprises, petroleum and petrochemical enterprises can take their own integration advantages of technologies, pipeline, market and so on, to develop underground coal gasification business based on their different needs and technical maturity, to effectively exploit a large amount of coal resources cleanly and to alleviate the tight supply of natural gas. It can also be combined with using the produced hydrogen in nearby area and the CO2 flooding and storage in adjacent oil areas to create a demonstration zone for net zero emissions of petroleum and petrochemical recycling economy. It is significant for reserving resources and technologies for the coming ""hydrogen economy"" era, and opening up a new path for China's ""clean, low carbon, safe and efficient"" modern energy system construction.",

Sequence I develops high stand systems tract and transgressive systems tract. The other third-order sequences are dominated by highstand systems tracts, and the transgressive systems tracts last shortly in time and are limited in area.

The homogenous fractured reservoir has higher oil recovery, and the bigger the aperture of fracture is, the higher the recovery. The main regions of remaining oil due to poor connectivity and gas-oil gravity difference include blind fractures and vugs below the connected fractures, the bottom of vugs, and the narrow and low-angle fractures. The accumulation of remaining oil in the bottom of reservoir is easily formed and controlled by the connections between producers and reservoir.

Horizontal wells have the best development effect, so horizontal well can be applied in fractured-vuggy reservoirs without bottom water.

Through cores observation and fracture statistics, combined with comprehensive analyses of physical property, mercury injection, logging and geochemical data, and comparisons of the sandbodies scales, reservoir physical properties, argillaceous laminae and fractures between source and reservoir in the eastern and western oil-bearing areas and in the central water producing area, it is found that the hydrocarbon accumulation patterns are different in the eastern, central and western areas, and the characteristics of hydrocarbon migration under the background of double- provenance were sorted out. The study results show that the crude oil in the eastern area has different Pr/Ph and sterane distribution from that in the western area. The oil and gas primarily migrated vertically. The high-quality source rocks and favorable source-reservoir-cap combinations lay the foundation for large-scale oil and gas accumulations. Vertically, the oil and gas enrichment is controlled by the scale of sandbody and the difference of physical properties, while on the plane, it is controlled by the connectivity of sandbodies, the argillaceous laminae between source rock and reservoir, the reservoir physical property and the fractures. The sandbodies of oil-rich zones in the eastern and western areas have large thickness, low shale content, good physical properties, weak heterogeneity, few argillaceous laminae and abundant fractures, all of which are favorable for the vertical migration and accumulation of oil and gas. In contrast, in the middle area with converging provenances, the reservoirs, composed of thin sandbodies, features rapid variation in lithology and physical properties, strong heterogeneity, poor continuity of sandbodies, abundant argillaceous laminae between source rock and reservoir, and few fractures, makes it difficult for the oil and gas to migrate vertically, and results in low oil enrichment degree ultimately.

The results show that the diffusion of Mn2+ conforms to the Fick diffusion law in porous media-gel system, and the diffusion speed of Mn2+ increases and the area of gel image decreases gradually with the increase of concentration, and the image of gel decreases faster and the pressure drop of water drive is larger in flooding experiment of manganese chloride with higher concentration.

The study shows that central volcanic eruptive facies are developed in Sichuan Basin, and their lithological assemblages and distribution characteristics show obvious differences. The igneous rocks are mainly distributed in three regions: the southwestern part of the basin has dominantly largescale overflow facies basalts; the central and western part of the basin, Jianyang-Santai area, develop intrusive rocks, volcanic lavas (basalts) and pyroclastic rocks; and the eastern part of Sichuan, Dazhou-Liangping area, only develop diabase and basalts. Five aspects of understandings are achieved: (1) The Upper Permian igneous rocks can be divided into intrusive rocks and extrusive rocks, with the extrusive rocks as the main body. The chemical compositions of the extrusive rocks are characterized by both alkaline basalt and tholeiitic basalt, and belong to the subalkaline type of transitional basalt magma eruption. (2) There are obvious rhythmic structures vertically among overflow facies basalt, and the single rhythmic layer consists of, from bottom up, pyroclastic rocks (undeveloped), gray and dark gray porphyritic basalts (unstable), dark gray and purple microcrystalline-cryptocrystalline basalts, dark greyish green porous and amygdaloid basalts; the central volcanic eruption shows the rhythm and the vertical sequence of volcanic clastic rocks (agglomerates and breccias), volcanic lava, tuffaceous lava from bottom to top. (3) The pore types of basalt and pyroclastic rocks are diverse, mainly dissolution pore and de-vitrification micropore, but their physical properties are different. Basalt is characterized by ultra-low pore permeability, small reservoir thickness, and reservoirs are distributed in the upper and middle parts of the cycle, with poor lateral comparability. Volcanic clastic rocks are medium to high porous reservoirs (Well YT1: porosity: 8.66％-16.48％, average 13.76％) with large thickness and good reservoir quality. (4) Natural gas in basalts in southwestern basin mainly comes from Middle Permian, and natural gas in volcanic clastic rocks in central and western basin comes from Cambrian Qiongzhusi Formation. (5) Analysis of igneous reservoir-forming conditions in different areas shows that there are relatively insufficient gas sources and great differences in preservation conditions in southwestern basin. Reservoirs are poorly developed and gas-bearing is complex. The Jianyang-Santai area in the central and western part of Sichuan Basin has abundant hydrocarbon sources, developed reservoir, favorable preservation conditions and favorable gas geological conditions, and it is a favorable area for gas exploration.",
