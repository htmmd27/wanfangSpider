This paper studies a new adaptive strategy of IPD in different complex networks, where agents can learn and adapt their strategies through reinforcement learning method. A temporal difference learning method is applied for designing the adaptive strategy to optimize the decision making process of the agents. Previous studies indicated that mutual cooperation is hard to emerge in the IPD. Therefore, three examples which based on square lattice network and scale-free network are provided to show two features of the adaptive strategy. First, the mutual cooperation can be achieved by the group with adaptive agents under scale-free network, and once evolution has converged mutual cooperation, it is unlikely to shift. Secondly, the adaptive strategy can earn a better payoff compared with other strategies in the square network. The analytical properties are discussed for verifying evolutionary stability of the adaptive strategy.",

On one hand, for a linear discrete time-invariant system, a triggering condition is derived based on the Lyapunov stability. Here, in order to further reduce the communication rate, we enforce a triggering condition only when the Lyapunov function will exceed its value at the last triggered time, but an average decrease is guaranteed. On the other hand, the feasibility is ensured by minimizing and optimizing the terminal constrained set between the maximal control invariant set and the target terminal set. Finally, we provide a simulation to verify the theoretical results. It’s shown that the proposed strategy achieves a good trade-off between the closed-loop system performance and communication rate.",

They contain multiple bridge machines working in parallel within their partially overlapping workspaces.Their scheduling problems can be abstracted into a serial-colored travelling salesman problem in which each salesman has some exclusive cities and some cities shared with its neighbor(s). To solve it, we develop a greedy algorithm that selects a neighboring city satisfying proximity. The algorithm allows a salesman to select randomly its shared cities and runs accordingly many times. It can thus be used to solve job scheduling problems for MBMS. Subsequently, a collision-free scheduling method is proposed to address both job scheduling and collision resolution issues of MBMS. It is an extension of the greedy algorithm by introducing time window constraints and a collision resolution mechanism. Thus, the augmented greedy algorithm can try its best to select stepwise a job for an individual machine such that no time overlaps exist between it and the job sequence of the neighboring machine dealt in the corresponding overlapping workspace; and remove such a time overlap only when it is inevitable. Finally, we conduct a case study of a large triplebridge waterjet cutting system by applying the proposed method.",

In the algorithm, a frame length requires dynamical adjustment to achieve higher identification efficiency.Generally, the adjustment of the frame length is not only related to the number of tags, but also to the occurrence probability of capture effect. Existing algorithms could estimate both the number of tags and the probability of capture effect. Under large-scale RFID tag identification, however, the number of tags would be much larger than an initial frame length. In this scenario, the existing algorithm’s estimation errors would substantially increase. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm called capture-aware Bayesian estimate, which adopts Bayesian rules to accurately estimate the number and the probability simultaneously.

The developed controller takes wind gusts,actuator faults and measurement noises as total perturbations which are estimated by improved extended state observer(ESO)and compensated by nonlinear feedback control law. So, the developed robust fault tolerant controller can successfully accomplish the tracking of the desired output values. Finally, some simulation studies are given to illustrate the effectiveness of fault recovery of the proposed scheme and also its ability to attenuate external disturbances that are introduced from environmental causes such as wind gusts and measurement noises.",

The approach presented firstly transforms the segmented acoustic scenes into bump and morse scalograms, as well as spectrograms; secondly, the spectrograms or scalograms are sent into pre-trained convolutional neural networks; thirdly,the features extracted from a subsequent fully connected layer are fed into(bidirectional) gated recurrent neural networks, which are followed by a single highway layer and a softmax layer;finally, predictions from these three systems are fused by a margin sampling value strategy. We then evaluate the proposed approach using the acoustic scene classification data set of 2017 IEEE AASP Challenge on Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events(DCASE). On the evaluation set, an accuracy of 64.0 % from bidirectional gated recurrent neural networks is obtained when fusing the spectrogram and the bump scalogram, which is an improvement on the 61.0 % baseline result provided by the DCASE 2017 organisers.

The current data of cloud systems is to be monitored, collected and used to reflect their state. Its use can potentially help cloud managers take some timely measures before fault occurrence in clouds. Because of the complex structure and dynamic change characteristics of the clouds, existing fault detection methods suffer from the problems of low efficiency and low accuracy. In order to solve them, this work proposes an online detection model based on asystematic parameter-search method called SVM-Grid, whose construction is based on a support vector machine(SVM). SVM-Grid is used to optimize parameters in SVM. Proper attributes of a cloud system’s running data are selected by using Pearson correlation and principal component analysis for the model. Strategies of predicting cloud faults and updating fault sample databases are proposed to optimize the model and improve its performance.In comparison with some representative existing methods, the proposed model can achieve more efficient and accurate fault detection for cloud systems.",

An adaptive gain higher order sliding mode observer has been proposed to estimate the velocity as well as unmeasured disturbances from the noisy position measurements.A differentiator structure containing the Lipschitz constant and Lebesgue measurable control input, is utilized for obtaining the estimates. Adaptive tuning algorithms are derived based on Lyapunov stability theory, for updating the observer gains,which will give enough flexibility in the choice of initial estimates.Moreover, it may help to cope with unexpected state jerks. The trajectory tracking problem is formulated as a finite horizon optimal control problem, which is solved online. The control constraints are incorporated by using a nonquadratic performance functional. An adaptive update law has been derived for tuning the step size in the optimization algorithm, which may help to improve the convergence speed. Moreover, it is an attractive alternative to the heuristic choice of step size for diverse operating conditions. The disturbance as well as state estimates from the higher order sliding mode observer are utilized by the plant output prediction model, which will improve the overall performance of the controller. The nonlinear dynamics defined in leader fixed Euler-Hill frame has been considered for the present work and the reference trajectories are generated using Hill-Clohessy-Wiltshire equations of unperturbed motion. The simulation results based on rigorous perturbation analysis are presented to confirm the robustness of the proposed approach.",

An adaptive iterative learning control(AILC) scheme is presented for a class of commensurate high-order uncertain nonlinear fractional order systems in the presence of disturbance.To facilitate the controller design, a sliding mode surface of tracking errors is designed by using sufficient conditions of linear fractional order systems. To relax the assumption of the identical initial condition in iterative learning control(ILC), a new boundary layer function is proposed by employing MittagLeffler function. The uncertainty in the system is compensated for by utilizing radial basis function neural network. Fractional order differential type updating laws and difference type learning law are designed to estimate unknown constant parameters and time-varying parameter, respectively. The hyperbolic tangent function and a convergent series sequence are used to design robust control term for neural network approximation error and bounded disturbance, simultaneously guaranteeing the learning convergence along iteration. The system output is proved to converge to a small neighborhood of the desired trajectory by constructing Lyapnov-like composite energy function(CEF)containing new integral type Lyapunov function, while keeping all the closed-loop signals bounded.

The control system utilizes both offline and online trajectory planning for reactive interaction with objects of different shapes and color using RGBD vision and proximity/contact sensors feedback where no prior knowledge of the objects is available. The RGB-D sensor is used to collect raw 3D information of the environment. The data is then processed to segment an object of interest in the scene. In order to completely explore the object, a coverage path planning technique is proposed using a dynamic 3D occupancy grid method to generate a primary(offline) trajectory. However, RGB-D sensors are very sensitive to lighting and provide only limited accuracy on the depth measurements. Therefore, the coverage path planning is then further assisted by a real-time adaptive path planning using a fuzzy self-tuning proportional integral derivative(PID)controller. The latter allows the robot to dynamically update the 3D model by a specially designed instrumented compliant wrist and adapt to the surfaces it approaches or touches. A modeswitching scheme is also proposed to efficiently integrate and smoothly switch between the interaction modes under certain conditions. Experimental results using a CRS-F3 manipulator equipped with a custom-built compliant wrist demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the proposed method.",

However, there are limitations for invariable controller dominated algorithms in practical situation,which makes them unable to meet changing environment. On the contrary, variable controller is more flexible and can be able to adapt to complex environment. Considering such advantages,a time-varying algorithm for swarm robotics is presented in this paper. The algorithm takes time as one of the independent variables so that the controller is no longer fixed through the time,but can be changed over time, which brings more choices for the swarm robot system.

A large number of existing results focus on the study of vision-based lane detection methods due to the extensive knowledge background and the low-cost of camera devices. In this paper, previous visionbased lane detection studies are reviewed in terms of three aspects, which are lane detection algorithms, integration, and evaluation methods. Next, considering the inevitable limitations that exist in the camera-based lane detection system, the system integration methodologies for constructing more robust detection systems are reviewed and analyzed. The integration methods are further divided into three levels, namely, algorithm, system,and sensor. Algorithm level combines different lane detection algorithms while system level integrates other object detection systems to comprehensively detect lane positions. Sensor level uses multi-modal sensors to build a robust lane recognition system. In view of the complexity of evaluating the detection system, and the lack of common evaluation procedure and uniform metrics in past studies, the existing evaluation methods and metrics are analyzed and classified to propose a better evaluation of the lane detection system. Next, a comparison of representative studies is performed. Finally, a discussion on the limitations of current lane detection systems and the future developing trends toward an Artificial Society, Computational experiment-based parallel lane detection framework is proposed.",

This is of great importance to a vehicle’s safety and ride comfort. In the U.S state of California, the Autonomous Vehicle Testing Regulations require every manufacturer testing autonomous vehicles on public roads to submit an annual report summarizing the disengagements of the technology experienced during testing. On 1 January 2016,seven manufacturers submitted their first disengagement reports:Bosch, Delphi, Google, Nissan, Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, and Tesla Motors. This work analyses the data from these disengagement reports with the aim of gaining abetter understanding of the situations in which a driver is required to takeover, as this is potentially useful in improving the Society of Automotive Engineers(SAE) Level 2 and Level 3 automation technologies.Disengagement events from testing are classified into different groups based on attributes and the causes of disengagement are investigated and compared in detail. The mechanisms and time taken for take-over transition occurred in disengagements are studied. Finally, recommendations for OEMs, manufacturers, and government organizations are also discussed.",

The uncertainty mainly affects the system dynamics due to mismatched parameter variation which is bounded by a predefined known function. In order to compensate the effect of uncertainty, a robust control input is derived by formulating an equivalent optimal control problem for a virtual nominal system with a modified costfunctional. To derive the stabilizing control law for a mismatched system, this paper introduces another control input named as virtual input. This virtual input is not applied directly to stabilize the uncertain system, rather it is used to define a sufficient condition. To solve the nonlinear optimal control problem, a discretetime general Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman(DT-GHJB) equation is considered and it is approximated numerically through a neural network(NN) implementation. The approximated solution of DTGHJB is used to compute the suboptimal control input for the virtual system. The suboptimal inputs for the virtual system ensure the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop uncertain system. A numerical example is illustrated with simulation results to prove the efficacy of the proposed control algorithm.",

In this paper, we investigate the multicast routing problem in the inter-cloud context with K constraints where K ≥ 2. Unlike most of existing algorithms that are too complex to be applied in practical scenarios, a novel and fast algorithm for establishing multicast routing tree for interclouds is proposed. The proposed algorithm leverages an entropybased process to aggregate all weights into a comprehensive metric, and then uses it to search a multicast tree(MT) on the basis of the shortest path tree(SPT). We conduct complexity analysis and extensive simulations for the proposed algorithm from the approximation perspective. Both analytical and experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm is more efficient than a representative multi-constrained multicast routing algorithm in terms of both speed and accuracy, and thus we believe that the proposed algorithm is applicable to the inter-cloud environment.",

This criterion is inspired by similarity preservation, which is widely used in single-label feature selection. It evaluates each feature subset by measuring its capability in preserving neighborhood relationship among samples. Unlike similarity preservation, we address the order of sample similarities which can well express the neighborhood relationship among samples, not just the pairwise sample similarity. With this criterion, we also design one ranking algorithm and one greedy algorithm for feature selection problem.

The simulation experiments show that the transportation fleets are increased effectively considering the substitution between vehicles. Substitution equilibrium point has the same results as integer programming but has much lower time complexity.,

The demands and the potential applications of AI technologies in power system control centers is discussed in the beginning of the paper. The discussion is based on the results of a field study in the Tianjin Power System Control Center in China. According to the study, one problem in power systems is that the power system analysis system in the control center is not fast and powerful enough to help the operators in time to deal with the incidents in the power system. Another issue in current power system control center is that the operation tickets are compiled manually by the operators, so that it is less efficient and human errors cannot be avoided. Based on these problems, a framework of the smart operating robot is proposed in this paper, which includes an intelligent power system analysis system and a smart operation ticket compiling system to solve the two problems in power system control centers. The proposed framework is mainly based on the AI techniques, especially the neural network with deep learning, since it is faster and more capable of dealing with the highly nonlinear and complex power system.",

The major difficulty is caused by the lack of basic knowledge in emotion expressions with respect to a variety of real world contexts. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian inference method to explore the latent semantic dimensions as contextual information in natural language and to learn the knowledge of emotion expressions based on these semantic dimensions. Our method synchronously infers the latent semantic dimensions as topics in words and predicts the emotion labels in both word-level and document-level texts. The Bayesian inference results enable us to visualize the connection between words and emotions with respect to different semantic dimensions. And by further incorporating a corpus-level hierarchy in the document emotion distribution assumption, we could balance the document emotion recognition results and achieve even better word and document emotion predictions. Our experiment of the wordlevel and the document-level emotion predictions, based on a well-developed Chinese emotion corpus Ren-CECps, renders both higher accuracy and better robustness in the word-level and the document-level emotion predictions compared to the state-of-theart emotion prediction algorithms.",

The novel adaptive control method is designed to reduce the amount of computations effectively.The uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop system is guaranteed by the proposed controller. A coupled motor drives(CMD) system, which satisfies the structure of nonlinear system,is taken for simulation to confirm the effectiveness of the method.Simulations show that the developed adaptive controller has favorable performance on tracking desired signal and verify the stability of the closed-loop system.",

Fortunately, the data gathering via random sensing can save energy of sensor nodes. Nevertheless, its randomness and density usually result in difficult implementations, high computation complexity and large storage spaces in practical settings. So the deterministic sparse sensing matrices are desired in some situations. However,it is difficult to guarantee the performance of deterministic sensing matrix by the acknowledged metrics. In this paper, we construct a class of deterministic sparse sensing matrices with statistical versions of restricted isometry property(St RIP) via regular low density parity check(RLDPC) matrices. The key idea of our construction is to achieve small mutual coherence of the matrices by confining the column weights of RLDPC matrices such that St RIP is satisfied. Besides, we prove that the constructed sensing matrices have the same scale of measurement numbers as the dense measurements. We also propose a data gathering method based on RLDPC matrix. Experimental results verify that the constructed sensing matrices have better reconstruction performance, compared to the Gaussian, Bernoulli, and CSLDPC matrices. And we also verify that the data gathering via RLDPC matrix can reduce energy consumption of WSNs.",

In contrast to the traditional cyber attack minimization techniques, this paper proposes a recursive systematic convolutional(RSC) code and Kalman filter(KF) based method in the context of smart grids.Specifically, the proposed RSC code is used to add redundancy in the microgrid states, and the log maximum a-posterior is used to recover the state information, which is affected by random noises and cyber attacks. Once the estimated states are obtained by KF algorithm, a semidefinite programming based optimal feedback controller is proposed to regulate the system states, so that the power system can operate properly. Test results show that the proposed approach can accurately mitigate the cyber attacks and properly estimate and control the system states.",

First,we present a formula for calculating the case similarity and changing trends in the case considered, where similar cases are obtained. Next, we describe a method for measuring the overall assessment value with respect to similar historical cases, which is obtained by aggregating the case similarity, the utility case similarity, the first response time, and the implementation effect.The subjective preferences and objective information are also integrated in the decision-making process.

On the demand side, factors such as household loads, storage batteries, the outside public utility grid and renewable energy resources, are combined together as a nonlinear, time-varying, indefinite and complex system, which is difficult to manage or optimize. Many nations have already applied the residential real-time pricing to balance the burden on their grid. In order to enhance electricity efficiency of the residential micro grid, this paper presents an action dependent heuristic dynamic programming(ADHDP) method to solve the residential energy scheduling problem. The highlights of this paper are listed below. First,the weather-type classification is adopted to establish three types of programming models based on the features of the solar energy. In addition, the priorities of different energy resources are set to reduce the loss of electrical energy transmissions.Second, three ADHDP-based neural networks, which can update themselves during applications, are designed to manage the flows of electricity. Third, simulation results show that the proposed scheduling method has effectively reduced the total electricity cost and improved load balancing process. The comparison with the particle swarm optimization algorithm further proves that the present method has a promising effect on energy management to save cost.",
