In China, underground coal gasification which is in accord with the clean utilization of coal can produce ""artificial gas"", which provides a new strategic approach to supply methane and hydrogen with Chinese characteristics before new energy sources offer large-scale supply. Coal measure strata in oil-bearing basins are developed in China, with 3.77 trillion tons coal reserves for the buried depth of 1000-3 000 m. It is initially expected that the amount of natural gas resources from underground coal gasification to be 272-332 trillion cubic meters, which are about triple the sum of conventional natural gas, or equivalent to the total unconventional natural gas resources. According to the differences of coal reaction mechanism and product composition of underground coal gasification, the underground coal gasification can be divided into three development modes, hydrogen-rich in shallow, methane-rich in medium and deep, supercritical hydrogen-rich in deep. Beyond the scope of underground mining of coal enterprises, petroleum and petrochemical enterprises can take their own integration advantages of technologies, pipeline, market and so on, to develop underground coal gasification business based on their different needs and technical maturity, to effectively exploit a large amount of coal resources cleanly and to alleviate the tight supply of natural gas.

The high-quality source rocks and favorable source-reservoir-cap combinations lay the foundation for large-scale oil and gas accumulations. Vertically, the oil and gas enrichment is controlled by the scale of sandbody and the difference of physical properties, while on the plane, it is controlled by the connectivity of sandbodies, the argillaceous laminae between source rock and reservoir, the reservoir physical property and the fractures. The sandbodies of oil-rich zones in the eastern and western areas have large thickness, low shale content, good physical properties, weak heterogeneity, few argillaceous laminae and abundant fractures, all of which are favorable for the vertical migration and accumulation of oil and gas. In contrast, in the middle area with converging provenances, the reservoirs, composed of thin sandbodies, features rapid variation in lithology and physical properties, strong heterogeneity, poor continuity of sandbodies, abundant argillaceous laminae between source rock and reservoir, and few fractures, makes it difficult for the oil and gas to migrate vertically, and results in low oil enrichment degree ultimately. For the exploration of continental multiple-provenance tight reservoirs, not only the good-property source rocks and reservoirs, but more importantly the source-reservoir contact relationship and the effect of fractures on the hydrocarbon migration and accumulation should be considered.",

The study shows that central volcanic eruptive facies are developed in Sichuan Basin, and their lithological assemblages and distribution characteristics show obvious differences. The igneous rocks are mainly distributed in three regions: the southwestern part of the basin has dominantly largescale overflow facies basalts; the central and western part of the basin, Jianyang-Santai area, develop intrusive rocks, volcanic lavas (basalts) and pyroclastic rocks; and the eastern part of Sichuan, Dazhou-Liangping area, only develop diabase and basalts. Five aspects of understandings are achieved: (1) The Upper Permian igneous rocks can be divided into intrusive rocks and extrusive rocks, with the extrusive rocks as the main body. The chemical compositions of the extrusive rocks are characterized by both alkaline basalt and tholeiitic basalt, and belong to the subalkaline type of transitional basalt magma eruption. (2) There are obvious rhythmic structures vertically among overflow facies basalt, and the single rhythmic layer consists of, from bottom up, pyroclastic rocks (undeveloped), gray and dark gray porphyritic basalts (unstable), dark gray and purple microcrystalline-cryptocrystalline basalts, dark greyish green porous and amygdaloid basalts; the central volcanic eruption shows the rhythm and the vertical sequence of volcanic clastic rocks (agglomerates and breccias), volcanic lava, tuffaceous lava from bottom to top. (3) The pore types of basalt and pyroclastic rocks are diverse, mainly dissolution pore and de-vitrification micropore, but their physical properties are different. Basalt is characterized by ultra-low pore permeability, small reservoir thickness, and reservoirs are distributed in the upper and middle parts of the cycle, with poor lateral comparability. Volcanic clastic rocks are medium to high porous reservoirs (Well YT1: porosity: 8.66％-16.48％, average 13.76％) with large thickness and good reservoir quality. (4) Natural gas in basalts in southwestern basin mainly comes from Middle Permian, and natural gas in volcanic clastic rocks in central and western basin comes from Cambrian Qiongzhusi Formation. (5) Analysis of igneous reservoir-forming conditions in different areas shows that there are relatively insufficient gas sources and great differences in preservation conditions in southwestern basin. Reservoirs are poorly developed and gas-bearing is complex. The Jianyang-Santai area in the central and western part of Sichuan Basin has abundant hydrocarbon sources, developed reservoir, favorable preservation conditions and favorable gas geological conditions, and it is a favorable area for gas exploration.",

The steps include the conversion of the time-migrated seismic image into depth domain image using a constant velocity field, structural interpretation of the depth seismic image, measurement of each structural relief area and each height above reference level, plotting of area-height relationship chart with piecewise fitting etc. The area-depth correlation can help the division of structural sequences, the definition of detachment levels, the calculation of the tectonic shortening, and the identification of deep-seated structure. The segment area-height relationship is a feature of multi-level detachment structures, while little or no linear correlation between area and height is an indicator of non-deformation or pseudo-anticline. Regardless of the uncertainty of area-height relationship, the segment slopes will correspond to the differential shortenings of multi-level detachments, the intersection between adjacent segments will give the height of detachment surface above reference level and then help define the detachment level in original time-domain seismic section. This method can make use of time-domain seismic data to determine the geologic structure of complicated structure areas and assess risks of deep exploration targets.

The plate homogeneous experiment and numerical simulation show that the technique can significantly improve the sweep efficiency and the effect of the oil displacement, and greatly improve the oil recovery rate. The optimal flooding parameters of the target transport technique are: the right angle target, the length of the channel is about 15％ of the well distance and the injection volume of the ternary composite system is 0.4 PV. Under such conditions, this technique can enhance recovery by 48.87％ and 22.04％ respectively, compared with the water flooding and conventional ASP flooding. The target transport technique solves the problem of high loss of chemical agent in near-wellbore area during the ASP flooding, and compensates for the high cost of ASP flooding and the limitation of application, and has a broad application prospect.",

Four types of lamina, namely organic-rich lamina, organic-bearing lamina, clay lamina and silty lamina, are developed in the Longmaxi Formation of Well Wuxi 2, and they form 2 kinds of lamina set and 5 kinds of beds. Because of increasing supply of terrigenous clasts and enhancing hydrodynamics and associated oxygen levels, the contents of TOC and brittle mineral reduce and content of clay mineral increases gradually as the depth becomes shallow. Organic-rich lamina, organic-rich + organic-bearing lamina set and organic-rich bed dominate the small layers 1-3 of Member 1 of the Longmaxi Formation, suggesting anoxic and weak hydraulic depositional setting. Organic-rich lamina, along with organic-bearing lamina and silty lamina, appear in small layer 4, suggesting increased oxygenated and hydraulic level. Small layers 1-3 are the best interval and drilling target of shale gas exploration and development.",
