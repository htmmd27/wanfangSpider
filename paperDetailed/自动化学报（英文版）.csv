Analysis of this big data allows for boundless potential outcomes for discovering knowledge. Big data analytics (BDA) in healthcare can, for instance, help determine causes of diseases, generate effective diagnoses, enhance QoS guarantees by increasing efficiency of the healthcare delivery and effectiveness and viability of treatments, generate accurate predictions of readmissions, enhance clinical care, and pinpoint opportunities for cost savings. However, BDA implementations in any domain are generally complicated and resource-intensive with a high failure rate and no roadmap or success strategies to guide the practitioners. In this paper, we present a comprehensive roadmap to derive insights from BDA in the healthcare (patient care) domain, based on the results of a systematic literature review. We initially determine big data characteristics for healthcare and then review BDA applications to healthcare in academic research focusing particularly on NoSQL databases. We also identify the limitations and challenges of these applications and justify the potential of NoSQL databases to address these challenges and further enhance BDA healthcare research. We then propose and describe a state-of-the-art BDA architecture called Med-BDA for healthcare domain which solves all current BDA challenges and is based on the latest zeta big data paradigm. We also present success strategies to ensure the working of Med-BDA along with outlining the major benefits of BDA applications to healthcare. Finally, we compare our work with other related literature reviews across twelve hallmark features to justify the novelty and importance of our work. The aforementioned contributions of our work are collectively unique and clearly present a roadmap for clinical administrators, practitioners and professionals to successfully implement BDA initiatives in their organizations.",

Most of existing RUL prediction methods are only interested in the precision of RUL estimation; the adverse impact of over-estimated RUL on maintenance scheduling is not of concern. In this work, an RUL estimation method with risk-averse adaptation is developed which can reduce the over-estimation rate while maintaining a reasonable under-estimation level. The proposed method includes a module of degradation feature selection to obtain crucial features which reflect system degradation trends. Then, the latent structure between the degradation features and the RUL labels is modeled by a support vector regression (SVR) model and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, respectively. To enhance the prediction robustness and increase its marginal utility, the SVR model and the LSTM model are integrated to generate a hybrid model via three connection parameters. By designing a cost function with penalty mechanism, the three parameters are determined using a modified grey wolf optimization algorithm. In addition, a cost metric is proposed to measure the benefit of such a risk-averse predictive maintenance method. Verification is done using an aero-engine data set from NASA. The results show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed RUL estimation method and the predictive maintenance strategy.",

The first strategy, namely the Nash strategy is derived based on the assumption that a Nash equilibrium is reached in a noncooperative game of vehicle path-following control involving a driver and a vehicle automated steering controller. The second one, namely the Stackelberg strategy is derived based on the assumption that a Stackelberg equilibrium is reached in a similar context. A simulation study is performed to study the differences between the two proposed noncooperative-game strategies. An experiment using a fixed-base driving simulator is carried out to measure six test drivers' steering behavior in response to vehicle automated steering intervention. The Nash strategy is then fitted to measured driver steering wheel angles following a model identification procedure. Control weight parameters involved in the Nash strategy are identified. It is found that the proposed Nash strategy with the identified control weights is capable of representing the trend of measured driver steering behavior and vehicle lateral responses. It is also found that the proposed Nash strategy is superior to the classic driver steering control strategy which has widely been used for modeling driver steering control over the past. A discussion on improving automated steering control using the gained knowledge of driver noncooperative-game steering control behavior was made.",

To increase the transmission rate in the limited spectrum resource, implementation of both non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and successive interference cancelation (SIC) is essential. In this paper, an optimal resource allocation algorithm in NOMA is proposed to maximize the total system rate in a multi-sector multi-subcarrier relay-assisted communication network. Since the original problem is a non-convex problem with mixed integer programming which is non-deterministic polynomial-time (NP)-hard, a three-step solution is proposed to solve the primal problem. Firstly, we determine the optimal power allocation of the outer users by using the approach of monotonic discrimination, and then the optimal user pairing is determined. Secondly, the successive convex approximation (SCA) method is introduced to transform the non-convex problem involving central users into convex one, and the Lagrangian dual method is used to determine the optimal solution. Finally, the standard Hungarian algorithm is utilized to determine the optimal subcarrier matching. The simulation results show that resource allocation algorithm is able to meet the user performance requirements with NOMA, and the total system rate is improved compared to the existing algorithms.",

The control objective is to regulate well the heave and the pitch motions of the chassis despite the road irregularities. The difficulty of the control problem lies in the nonlinearity of the system model, the uncertainty of some of its parameters, and the inaccessibility to measurements of the hysteresis internal state variables. Using Lyapunov control design tools, we design two observers to get online estimates of the hysteresis internal states and a stabilizing adaptive state-feedback regulator. The whole adaptive controller is formally shown to meet the desired control objectives.

A new representation is proposed to model the measurement outlier by an impulsive signal whose minimum interval length (i.e., the minimum duration between two adjacent impulsive signals) and minimum norm (i.e., the minimum of the norms of all impulsive signals) are larger than certain thresholds that are adjustable according to engineering practice. In order to guarantee satis-factory filtering performance, a so-called parameter-dependent set-membership filter is put forward that is capable of generating a time-varying ellipsoidal region containing the true system state. First, a novel outlier detection strategy is developed, based on a dedicatedly constructed input-output model, to examine whether the received measurement is corrupted by an outlier. Then, through the outcome of the outlier detection, the gain matrix of the desired filter and the corresponding ellipsoidal region are calculated by solving two recursive difference equations. Furthermore, the ultimate boundedness issue on the time-varying ellipsoidal region is thoroughly investigated.

Initially, the cubic B-spline interpolation is used to solve time alignment problems of multi-source data. Then, the reinforcement learning based data fusion (RLBDF) method is proposed to obtain the fusion results. With the case that the priori knowledge of target is obtained, the fusion accuracy reinforcement is realized by the error between fused value and actual value. Furthermore, the Fisher information is instead used as the reward if the priori knowledge is unable to be obtained. Simulations results verify that the developed method is feasible and effective for the multi-sensors data fusion in air combat.",

A typical driver or aconventional adaptive cruise control (ACC) controls an electricvehicle (EV) such that it follows a lead vehicle or drives close tothe speed limit. This driving behaviour may cause the EV tocruise significantly above the average traffic speed. It may laterrequire the EV to slow down due to the traffic ripples, wasting apart of the EV's kinetic energy. In addition, the EV will alsowaste higher speed dependent dissipative energies, which arespent to overcome the aerodynamic drag force and rolling resist-ance. This paper proposes a CCS to address this issue. The pro-posed CCS controls an EV's speed such that it prevents thevehicle from speeding significantly above the average trafficspeed. In addition, it maintains a safe inter-vehicular distancefrom the lead vehicle. The design and simulation analysis of theproposed CCS were in a MATLAB simulation environment. Thesimulation environment includes an energy consumption model ofan EV, which was developed using data collected from an electricbus operation in London. In the simulation analysis, the pro-posed system reduced the EV's energy consumption by approx-imately 36.6％ in urban drive cycles and 15.4％ in motorway drivecycles. Finally, the experimental analysis using a Nissan e-NV200on two urban routes showed approximately 30.8％ energy savings.",

Use of wide-area signal is more effective than the local area signal in damping out the inter-area oscilla-tions. Wide area measurement system (WAMS) is convenient to transmit the wide area signal through the communication chan-nel to the remote location. Communication failure is one of the disastrous phenomena in a communication channel. In this paper, a dual input single output (DISO) H∞ controller is designed to build the control resiliency by employing two highest observabil-ity ranking wide area signals with respect to the critical damping inter-area mode. The proposed controller can provide sufficient damping to the system and also the system remains stabilized if one of the wide-area signals is lost. The time delay is an un-wanted phenomenon that degrades the performance of the con-trollers. The unified Smith predictor approach is used to design a H∞ controller to handle the time delay.

Based on the matrix theory, the whole system is decoupled into several subsystems with respect to the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix. Considering that the eigenvalues may be complex numbers, the consensus problem of the multi-agent system is transformed into the stabilizing problem of all the subsystems with complex coefficients.

A distributed real-time multiple vehicle collision avoidance (MVCA) algorithm is proposed by extending the reciprocal nnn-body colli-sion avoidance method. MVCA enables the intelligent vehicles to choose their destinations and control inputs independently, without needing to negotiate with each other or with the coordinator. Compared to the centralized trajectory-planning algorithm, MVCA reduces computation costs and greatly im-proves the robustness of the system. Because the destination of each intelligent vehicle can be regarded as private, which can be protected by MVCA, at the same time MVCA can provide a real-time trajectory planning for intelligent vehicles. Therefore, MVCA can better improve the safety of intelligent vehicles. The simulation was conducted in MATLAB, including crossroads scene simulation and circular exchange position simulation. The results show that MVCA behaves safely and reliably. The effects of latency and packet loss on MVCA are also statistically inves-tigated through theoretically formulating broadcasting process based on one-dimensional Markov chain. The results uncover that the tolerant delay should not exceed the half of deciding cycle of trajectory planning, and shortening the sending interval could alleviate the negative effects caused by the packet loss to an extent. The cases of short delay (<<<111000000 ms) and low packet loss (<<<555％％％) can bring little influence to those trajectory planning algorithms that only depend on V2V to sense the context, but the unpredictable collision may occur if the delay and packet loss are further worsened.

Nagar","2020, 7(5)","Brain-Computer interfacing (BCI) has currently added a new dimension in assistive robotics. Existing brain-computer interfaces designed for position control applications suffer from two fundamental limitations. First, most of the existing schemes employ open-loop control, and thus are unable to track positional errors, resulting in failures in taking necessary online corrective actions. There are examples of a few works dealing with closed-loop electroencephalography (EEG)-based position control. These existing closed-loop brain-induced position control schemes employ a fixed order link selection rule, which often creates a bottleneck preventing time-efficient control. Second, the existing brain-induced position controllers are designed to generate a position response like a traditional first-order system, resulting in a large steady-state error. This paper overcomes the above two limitations by keeping provisions for steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) induced link-selection in an arbitrary order as required for efficient control and generating a second-order response of the position-control system with gradually diminishing overshoots/undershoots to reduce steady-state errors. Other than the above, the third innovation is to utilize motor imagery and P300 signals to design the hybrid brain-computer interfacing system for the said application with gradually diminishing error-margin using speed reversal at the zero-crossings of positional errors. Experiments undertaken reveal that the steady-state error is reduced to 0.2％. The paper also provides a thorough analysis of the stability of the closed-loop system performance using the Root Locus technique.",

Traditionally, the elastic-model-based method was used to reconstruct 3D shapes by deforming the control points on the elastic mesh. However, the reconstructed shape is not smooth because the limited control points are only distributed on the edge of the elastic mesh. Alternatively, statistical-model-based methods, which include shape-model-based and intensity-model-based methods, are introduced due to their smooth reconstruction. However, both suffer from limitations. With the shape-model-based method, only the boundary profile is considered, leading to the loss of valid intensity information. For the intensity-based-method, the computation speed is slow because it needs to calculate the intensity distribution in each iteration. To address these issues, we propose a new reconstruction method using X-ray images and a specimen's CT data. Specifically, the CT data provides both the shape mesh and the intensity model of the vertebra. Intensity model is used to generate the deformation field from X-ray images, while the shape model is used to generate the patient specific model by applying the calculated deformation field.

Furthermore, an augmented Lagrange multipliers (ALM) iterative algorithm is presented to optimize the proposed model.

However, there are still unsolved shortcomings of NSA that limit its further applications. For example, the nonself-detector generation efficiency is low; a large number of nonself-detector is needed for precise detection; low detection rate with various application data sets. Aiming at those problems, a novel radius adaptive based on center-optimized hybrid detector generation algorithm (RACO-HDG) is put forward. To our best knowledge, radius adaptive based on center optimization is first time analyzed and proposed as an efficient mechanism to improve both detector generation and detection rate without significant computation complexity. RACO-HDG works efficiently in three phases. At first, a small number of self-detectors are generated, different from typical NSAs with a large number of self-sample are generated. Nonself-detectors will be generated from those initial small number of self-detectors to make hybrid detection of self-detectors and nonself-detectors possible. Secondly, without any prior knowledge of the data sets or manual setting, the nonself-detector radius threshold is self-adaptive by optimizing the nonself-detector center and the generation mechanism. In this way, the number of abnormal detectors is decreased sharply, while the coverage area of the nonself-detector is increased otherwise, leading to higher detection performances of RACO-HDG. Finally, hybrid detection algorithm is proposed with both self-detectors and nonself-detectors work together to increase detection rate as expected. Abundant simulations and application results show that the proposed RACO-HDG has higher detection rate, lower false alarm rate and higher detection efficiency compared with other excellent algorithms.",

Such problems appear in several branches of science and technology, ranging from target tracking to biomedical monitoring. A commonly practiced approach of filtering with nonlinear systems is Gaussian filtering. The early Gaussian filters used a derivative-based implementation, and suffered from several drawbacks, such as the smoothness requirements of system models and poor stability. A derivative-free numerical approximation-based Gaussian filter, named the unscented Kalman filter (UKF), was introduced in the nineties, which offered several advantages over the derivative-based Gaussian filters. Since the proposition of UKF, derivative-free Gaussian filtering has been a highly active research area. This paper reviews significant developments made under Gaussian filtering since the proposition of UKF. The review is particularly focused on three categories of developments: i) advancing the numerical approximation methods; ii) modifying the conventional Gaussian approach to further improve the filtering performance; and iii) constrained filtering to address the problem of discrete-time formulation of process dynamics. This review highlights the computational aspect of recent developments in all three categories. The performance of various filters are analyzed by simulating them with real-life target tracking problems.",

The resulting dynamic pricing problems can be regarded as sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty, which is solved by means of stochastic dynamic programming (DP) based algorithms. In this regard, Bellman's backward principle of optimality is exploited in order to provide all the implementation mechanisms for the proposed reservation pricing algorithm. The curse of dimensionality, as the inevitable issue of the DP both for instant resource requests and future resource reservations, occurs.

Fabricated using soft materials, soft robots have gained much attention in academia and industry during recent years because of their inherent safety in human interaction. However, due to structural flexibility and compliance, mathemat-ical models for these soft robots are nonlinear with an infinite de-gree of freedom (DOF). Therefore, accurate position (or orienta-tion) control and optimization of their dynamic response remains a challenging task. Most existing soft robots currently employed in industrial and rehabilitation applications use model-free con-trol algorithms such as PID. However, to the best of our know-ledge, there has been no systematic study on the comparative per-formance of model-free control algorithms and their ability to op-timize dynamic response, i.e., reduce overshoot and settling time. In this paper, we present comparative performance of several variants of model-free PID-controllers based on extensive experi-mental results. Additionally, most of the existing work on model-free control in pneumatic soft-robotic literature use manually tuned parameters, which is a time-consuming, labor-intensive task. We present a heuristic-based coordinate descent algorithm to tune the controller parameter automatically. We presented res-ults for both manual tuning and automatic tuning using the Zieg-ler–Nichols method and proposed algorithm, respectively. We then used experimental results to statistically demonstrate that the presented automatic tuning algorithm results in high accuracy. The experiment results show that for soft robots, the PID-con-troller essentially reduces to the PI controller. This behavior was observed in both manual and automatic tuning experiments; we also discussed a rationale for removing the derivative term.",

We achieve this by adaptively adjusting the step-size in each iteration using the adaptive moment estimation (ADAM) update rule. The pro-posed algorithm also increases the convergence rate in a narrow valley. A key feature of the ADAM update rule is the ability to adjust the step-size for each dimension separately instead of us-ing the same step-size. Since ADAM is traditionally used with gradient-based optimization algorithms, therefore we first pro-pose a gradient estimation model without the need to differenti-ate the objective function. Resultantly, it demonstrates excellent performance and fast convergence rate in searching for the op-timum of non-convex functions. The efficiency of the proposed al-gorithm was tested on three different benchmark problems, in-cluding the training of a high-dimensional neural network.

In this paper, we use nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) and an extension of the echo state network called an echo state Gaussian process (ESGP) to design a tracking controller for a PMA-driven lower limb exoskeleton. The dynamics of the system include the PMA actuation and mechanism of the leg orthoses; thus, the system is represented by two nonlinear uncertain subsystems. To facilitate the design of the controller, joint angles of leg orthoses are forecasted based on the universal approximation ability of the ESGP. A gradient descent algorithm is employed to solve the optimization problem and generate the control signal. The stability of the closed-loop system is guaranteed when the ESGP is capable of approximating system dynamics. Simulations and experiments are conducted to verify the approximation ability of the ESGP and achieve gait pattern training with four healthy subjects.",

A decentralized hybrid sampled-data strategy is introduced to save energy consumption and reduce the transmission load of the network. In the proposed decentralized strategy, each subsystem can decide independently whether its state should be transmitted to the controller or not. The scheme of the hybrid triggering mechanism for each subsystem composed of two stages: In the first stage, the next sampling instant is computed using a self-triggering strategy. Subsequently, in the second stage, an event-triggering condition is checked at these sampling instants and the control signal is computed only if the event-triggering condition is violated. The self-triggering condition used in the first stage is dependent on the selection of event-triggering condition of the second stage.

Task scheduling and resource allocation in DGCs have gained more attention in both academia and industry as they are costly to manage because of high energy consumption. Many factors in DGCs, e.g., prices of power grid, and the amount of green energy express strong spatial variations. The dramatic increase of arriving tasks brings a big challenge to minimize the energy cost of a DGC provider in a market where above factors all possess spatial variations. This work adopts a G/G/1 queuing system to analyze the performance of servers in DGCs. Based on it, a single-objective constrained optimization problem is formulated and solved by a proposed simulated-annealing-based bees algorithm (SBA) to find SBA can minimize the energy cost of a DGC provider by optimally allocating tasks of heterogeneous applications among multiple DGCs, and specifying the running speed of each server and the number of powered-on servers in each GC while strictly meeting response time limits of tasks of all applications.

Nonparametric Gaussian processes normally re-quire a large number of training data points to deal with the dis-continuity of the estimated model. Although some improved method such as probabilistic inference for learning control (PILCO) does not require an explicit global model as the actions are obtained by directly searching the policy space, the overfit-ting and lack of model complexity may still result in a large devi-ation between the prediction and the real system. Besides, none of these approaches consider the data error and measurement noise during the training process and test process, respectively. We propose a hierarchical Gaussian processes (GP) models, contain-ing two layers of independent GPs, where the physically continu-ous probability transition model of the robot is obtained. Due to the physically continuous estimation, the algorithm overcomes the overfitting problem with a guaranteed model complexity, and the number of training data is also reduced. The policy for any given initial state is generated automatically by minimizing the expec-ted cost according to the predefined cost function and the ob-tained probability distribution of the state. Furthermore, a novel Q(λ) based MFRL method scheme is employed to improve the policy.

In real applica-tions, for a given network, it is always desirable to have more selections for driver nodes which make the network structurally controllable. Different from the works in complex network field where structural controllability is often used to explore the emergence properties of complex networks at a macro level, in this paper, we investigate it for control design purpose at the application level and focus on describing and obtaining the solution space for all selections of driver nodes to guarantee structural controllability. In accord with practical applications, we define the complete selection rule set as the solution space which is composed of a series of selection rules expressed by intuitive algebraic forms. It explicitly indicates which nodes must be controlled and how many nodes need to be controlled in a node set and thus is particularly helpful for freely selecting driver nodes. Based on two algebraic criteria of structural controllability, we separately develop an input-connectivity al-gorithm and a relevancy algorithm to deduce selection rules for driver nodes. In order to reduce the computational complexity, we propose a pretreatment algorithm to reduce the scale of network's structural matrix efficiently, and a rearrangement algorithm to partition the matrix into several smaller ones. A general procedure is proposed to get the complete selection rule set for driver nodes which guarantee network's structural controllability. Simulation tests with efficiency analysis of the proposed algorithms are given and the result of applying the proposed procedure to some real networks is also shown, and these all indicate the validity of the proposed procedure.",

The boundary control in this system is related to the valve actuation located at the pipeline terminus through a valve closing model.

Then, the optimal boundary control problem is reduced to a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem that can be solved using nonlinear optimization tech-niques such as sequential quadratic programming (SQP). Finally, we conclude the paper with simulation results demonstrating that the full parameterization (FP) method eliminates pressure shock effectively and costs less computation time compared with the control vector parameterization (CVP) method.",

Passive incomplete information refers to incomplete data and information caused by practical system limitations during data collection, storage, transmission, and processing, such as data dropouts, delays, disordering, and limited transmission bandwidth. Active incomplete information refers to incomplete data and information caused by man-made reduction of data quantity and quality on the premise that the given objective is satisfied, such as sampling and quantization. This survey emphasizes two aspects:the first one is how to guarantee good learning performance and tracking performance with passive incomplete data, and the second is how to balance the control performance index and data demand by active means. The promising research directions along this topic are also addressed, where data robustness is highly emphasized. This survey is expected to improve understanding of the restrictive relationship and trade-off between incomplete data and tracking performance, quantitatively, and promote further developments of ILC theory.",

A steady-state mul-tiple reactors gradient optimization, unsteady-state operational-pattern adjustment strategy, and a process evaluation strategy based on the oxidation-reduction potential are proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed research is demonstrated by its industrial experiment.",

In this paper, we investigate the multicast routing problem in the inter-cloud context with K constraints where K ≥2.Unlike most of existing algorithms that are too complex to be applied in practical scenarios,a novel and fast algorithm for establishing multicast routing tree for inter-clouds is proposed.The proposed algorithm leverages an entropy-based process to aggregate all weights into a comprehensive metric, and then uses it to search a multicast tree (MT) on the basis of the shortest path tree(SPT).We conduct complexity anal-ysis and extensive simulations for the proposed algorithm from the approximation perspective.Both analytical and experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm is more efficient than a representative multi-constrained multicast routing algorithm in terms of both speed and accuracy, and thus we believe that the proposed algorithm is applicable to the inter-cloud environment.",

We present explicit symplectic geometric algorithms to deal with the quaternion kinematical differential equation by modelling its time-invariant and time-varying versions with Hamiltonian systems and adopting a three-step strategy. Firstly, a generalized Euler's formula and Cayley-Euler formula are proved and used to construct symplectic single-step transition operators via the centered implicit Euler scheme for autonomous Hamiltonian system. Secondly, the symplecticity, orthogonality and invertibility of the symplectic transition operators are proved rigorously. Finally, the explicit symplectic geometric algorithm for the time-varying quaternion kinematical differential equa-tion, i.e., a non-autonomous and non-linear Hamiltonian system essentially, is designed with the theorems proved. Our novel algorithms have simple structures, linear time complexity and constant space complexity of computation.

In order to investigate the role of SC in shaping resting-state FC, numerous models have been proposed. Here, we use a simple dynamic model based on the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model along the shortest paths to predict FC from SC. Unlike the previous dynamic model based on SIS theory, we focus on the shortest paths as the principal routes to transmit signals rather than the empirical structural brain network. We first simplify the structurally connected network into an efficient propagation network according to the shortest paths and then combine SIS infection theory with the efficient network to simulate the dynamic process of human brain activity. Finally, we perform an extensive comparison study between the dynamic models embedded in the efficient network, the dynamic model embedded in the structurally connected network and dynamic mean field (DMF) model predicting FC from SC. Extensive experiments on two different resolution datasets indicate that i) the dynamic model simulated on the shortest paths can predict FC among both structurally connected and unconnected node pairs; ii) though there are fewer links in the efficient propagation network, the predictive power of FC derived from the efficient propagation network is better than the dynamic model simulated on a structural brain network; iii) in comparison with the DMF model, the dynamic model embedded in the shortest paths is found to perform better to predict FC.",
